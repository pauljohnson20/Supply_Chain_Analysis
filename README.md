### Project Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing the supply chain performance using a Tableau dashboard. The dashboard presents key metrics such as customer sales, quantity, lead time, and delivery performance. Filters allow users to explore data by year, quarter, or month and analyze top products.

### Business Objective:
